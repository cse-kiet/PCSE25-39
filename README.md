# Title of Project: [Object Detection Using Machine Learning]

## Team Members:
1. [Vishal Soni (2100290100190)]
2. [Vinay Upadhyay (2100290100189)]
3. [Satyam Aditya (2100290100150)]

## Steps for Execution:
1. Install required libraries using `pip install opencv-python numpy`.
2. Download and place `yolov3.weights`, `yolov3.cfg`, and `yolov3.txt` in the project directory.
3. Run the Python script `object_detection.py` to start real-time object detection via webcam.
4. Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes and printed on the console (or spoken out if using the voice-enabled version).
5. Press `Q` to quit the detection window.
